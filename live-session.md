# Live Session

Castor's Live Session feature enables users to host and join live presentations made on their model of choice. Participants' cameras will be synchronized with the host's camera whenever the host moves his/her camera.

### Sub-features

-   Control transfer: the host may choose to transfer control to a participant (ie. if they want to call focus to a certain feature). The host may at any time reclaim their control, and the participant may relinquish control themselves. During the time that they are in control, all participants' cameras (including the host's) will instead be synchronized to the controlling participant's.
-   Selection synchronization: any feature selected by the host will be selected for all participants.
-   Sort synchronization: any sort started by the host will be mirrored in real-time for all participants.
